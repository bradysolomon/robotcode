# CO2 Sensor

  The CO2 Sensor code is set up to read the amount of CO2 that the sensor picks up every second.
  When running, the code will print out one of two things: "No Life Detected" or "Life".
  When "Life" is printed, the code will also print the level of co2 measured.

# Wiring the Sensor

  When wiring the sensor, we are currently connecting to the GPIO pins.
  Our grounding wire connects to pin 6
  Our wire transmitting power connects to pin 2
  The TXD wire is connected to pin 8
  The RXD wire is connected to pin 10
  In the folder is a picture to show the wiring guide.
